Algorithm of Operator:
- For each clusterDeployment that matches Labels
    - if match(clusterDeployment, timeFrame) 
        - if clusterDeployment.Replicas != 0
            -> statusDeployment.Replicas = clusterDeployment.Replicas
            -> clusterDeployment.Replicas = 0
    - else 
        - if statusDeployment
            -> clusterDeployment.Replicas = statusDeployment.Replicas
            -> delete(statusDeployment)

If a new deployment that matches labels is deployed => poweroff
